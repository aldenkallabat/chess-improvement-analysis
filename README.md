# Chess Improvement Analysis
## An exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and strategies that lead to measurable improvements in chess ratings.
Lichess.org is one of the most widely used online platforms for playing real-time chess matches against players from around the world. This platform uses a dynamic rating system to represent each playerâ€™s skill level, helping to match opponents of similar ability and track progress over time. Currently rated 1320 on Lichess.org, my goal is to improve my rating as efficiently as possible, without investing in formal coaching or extensive study. To support this goal, I analyzed a dataset of over 20,000 Lichess.org matches to uncover patterns and strategies that can lead to measurable improvement. This project leverages data-driven analysis to uncover practical, actionable insights for accelerating skill growth in online chess, presenting findings in a clear and understandable format.

**Hypothesis:**
By analyzing trends in opening choices, time controls, and opponent rating ranges, I can discover actionable patterns that correlate with higher win rates and use them to improve my chess rating over time.

**Conclusion:**
By analyzing and implementing trends in opening choices, time controls, and opponent rating ranges, I can improve my chess rating by up to 51%, bringing my initial rating of 1320 up to 1993 after completing 100 matches. This gain includes a 14% boost from using optimal openings, a 28% increase by consistently playing the 8+0 time control, and a 9% improvement from targeting opponents roughly 180 points higher in rating.
